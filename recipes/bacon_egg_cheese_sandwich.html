        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A breakfast classic, the bacon, egg, and cheese is an incredibly flavorful meal for any time of day.  One of the key things I feel that is lacking is a dressing or sauce to bring it together.  For this, I use the <strong>egg yolk</strong> by leaving it whole during cooking and breaking it in the sandwich.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p> For this recipe you will need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Thick Cut Bacon</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Cheese (choose one you like)</li>
            <li>Bread (choose one you like</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p> For this recipe you will need to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Starting from a cold pan, lay the Thick Cut Bacon in one layer</li>
            <li>Set the heat to medium and cook making sure to turn frequently.</li>
            <li>Once the Thick Cut Bacon is cooked, remove and drain most of the oil from the pan, but leave enough to coat the pan.</li>
            <li>Crack the Eggs on the pan.</li>
            <li>Season with Salt and Pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Place Bread on the pan alongside Eggs to toast</li>
            <li>Cover the pan to ensure the yolk cooks but <strong> does not harden.</strong>  We want to make sure the yolk can still run.</li>
            <li>Once Eggs are finshed, assemble the sandwich in the pan layering eggs, cheese, and then bacon.</li>
            <li>Remove the sandwich from the pan to a plate and press down to break the yolks.</li>
            <li>Cut in half or leave whole and enjoy.</li>

        </ol>
