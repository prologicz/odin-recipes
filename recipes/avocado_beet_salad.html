        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe was inspired by the "Avocado Matrix" in the book <em>Salt Fat Acid Heat</em> by Samin Nosrat.  It brings together several distinct flavors into an incredible experience.</p>

        <p>The book allows for different combinations of vegetables, dressings, and toppings but this is one of the simpler yet flavorful ones.  Using spring mix, ripe avocados, roasted beets, some citrus (in this case oranges) and a lime vinaigrette, this salad makes a refreshing lunch.  Remember to <strong>season every ingredient</strong> to get the best out of this salad.</p>
